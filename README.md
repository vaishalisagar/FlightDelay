1.1 Problem Statement

A flight delay is when an airline flight takes off and/or lands later than its scheduled time. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers a flight to be delayed when it is 15 minutes later than its scheduled time. The Flight Delay Prediction finds the probability that a specific flight will be delayed or not. It is a binary classification problem where 1 refers to delay status and 0 is on time. The flight can be delayed due to multiple reason as below

1.2 Importance of the Analysis <br>

US airline passengers increasingly have access to flight delay information. As a result, air passenger travel decisions can be expected to be influenced by delay information. In addition, delays affect airline operations, resulting in increased block times on routes and, in general, higher carrier costs and airfares. Hence, there is a high requirement of predicitng the flight status in aviation industry.

1.3 Stakeholders <br>
For this problem, Airline is the key stakeholders, as they will detect whether a flight is on time or not. This helps in saving a lot of time and cost. This analysis can be helful to other stakeholders like FAA or traveling agencies

1.4 End Goal <br>
Accurate analysis, testing and classification of flight status and back the story by data provided and deploy the model on web.
